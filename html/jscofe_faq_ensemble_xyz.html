<h2><i>"Ensemble"</i> and <i>"XYZ Coordinates"</i></h2>

<i>"Ensemble"</i> and <i>"XYZ Coordinates"</i> are related, but not identical,
types of data in jsCoFE. <i>"XYZ Coordinates"</i> is a simple type, representing
bare atomic coordinates, commonly obtained from a PDB or mmCIF-formatted files.
<i>"Ensemble"</i> is a complex type used to represent an ensemble of models for
Molecular Replacement (MR). It includes XYZ coordinates of one or more macromolecular
chains (which must be close structural neighbours to each other), but also a
reference to target sequence these chains relate to, along with the corresponding
similarity scores.
<p>
<center>
<b><i>In jsCoFE, Molecular Replacement is based solely on using "Ensembles",<br>
rather than models as bare macromolecular chains from "XYZ Coordinates"</i></b>
</center>
<p>
There are two main reasons for disallowing direct use of <i>"XYZ Coordinates"</i>
in MR tasks. Firstly, it makes the model preparation step mandatory and
unavoidable. This may seem redundant and even annoying in some cases, but,
in general, a proper preparation of MR model is crucial for MR success.
Secondly, a separate preparatory task identifies specific
<i>"XYZ Coordinates"</i> objects which can be used for MR apart of those
containing, e.g., ligand structures. Alltogether, this results in better
structured projects, clearer task interfaces and, hopefully, fewer mistakes
on user side.
<p>
<i>"Ensembles"</i> may be created using one of the following tasks, which should
be run prior attempting MR with <i>Molrep</i> or <i>Phaser</i> (note that
automatic MR pipelines (<i>Balbes</i>, <i>MrBump</i>, <i>MoRDa</i>, <i>Ample</i>,
<i>Simbad</i>) contain own model preparation modules and do not require
<i>"Ensemble"</i> objects on input).

    Prepare <i>"Ensemble"</i> from macromolecular sequence.</i></h3>

This task tries to find suitable structural homologues using sequence-based
search in the PDB. All sufficiently similar sequence homologues are clustered
and clusters are scored by similarity to target sequence. All chains in each
cluster are cross-superposed, trimmed as necessary, and then converted to
<i>"Ensembles"</i> data object. All necessary scores, which are used as default
values in consequent <i>Phaser</i> tasks, are automatically computed and
stored in the resulting <i>"Ensembles"</i>.

    Prepare <i>"Ensemble"</i> from <i>"XYZ Coordinates"</i>.</i></h3>

This tasks makes a single <i>"Ensemble"</i> object from one or more macromolecular
chains, represented by the corresponding <i>"XYZ Coordinates"</i> objects. All
chains are cross-superposed, trimmed as necessary, and then converted to the
<i>"Ensemble"</i> data object. Optionally, a reference to target sequence may be
added to the object. All necessary scores, which are used as default values in
consequent <i>Phaser</i> tasks, are automatically computed and stored in
the resulting <i>"Ensemble"</i>.

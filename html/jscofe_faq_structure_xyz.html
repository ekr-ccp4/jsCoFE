<h2><i>"Structure Revision"</i>, <i>"Structure Data"</i> and <i>"XYZ Coordinates"</i></h2>

<i>"Structure Revision"</i>, <i>"Structure Data"</i> and <i>"XYZ Coordinates"</i>
are different data types, related to each other by encapsulation.
<p>
<i>"XYZ Coordinates"</i> is a primitive data type, which represents bare atomic
coordinates, commonly obtained from a PDB or mmCIF-formatted files.
<p>
<i>"Structure Data"</i> is a complex type used to represent a solution (possibly
incomplete or approximate) to the crystallographic problem. It includes XYZ
coordinates of asymmetric unit, phases and density map.
<p>
<i>"Structure Revision"</i> is the most general data type in jsCoFE, used to
represent a snapshot of the structure solution process. It contains the definition of
<i>Asymmetric Unit</i> (set of macromolecular chains and their stoichiometric
coefficients), <i>HKL reflection dataset</i>, <i>Structure Data</i> and many other
details such as solvent content, ligand descriptions etc.
<p>
Some tasks, such as, e.g., Gesamt or PISA, use only XYZ coordnates in no
connection to reflection data, and they usually can take both <i>"Structure Data"</i>
and <i>"XYZ Coordinates"</i> on input. Other tasks, such as Refinement or
Model Building, need additional data, such as reflection datasets and sequences,
therefore, <i>"Structure Revision"</i> type is used in their input.

    Convert <i>"XYZ Coordinates"</i> to <i>"Structure Revision"</i></h3>

Using <i>"Structure Revision"</i>, <i>"Structure Data"</i> or
<i>"XYZ Coordinates"</i> data types should pose no confusion except in rare cases
when derived data is imported in jsCoFE project, rather than created in
the course of it. For example, a user imports a pair of PDB and MTZ files, which
results in the formation of <i>"XYZ Coordinates"</i> and <i>"HKL"</i> data types,
but no <i>"Structure Data"</i> and <i>"Structure Revision"</i>. Then, tasks
such as Refinement or Model Building, cannot be formed.
<p>
Such cases should be rare and treated as special, therefore avoided whenever
possible. In cases when import of derived data is absolutely necessary, jsCoFE
includes task <a href="jscofe_task_xyz2revision.html">Convert Coordinates to
Structure Revision</a>, which creates new <i>"Structure Data"</i> and the
corresponding <i>"Structure Revision"</i> objects. Then, the newly created
objects can be used in subsequent jobs. Note that the conversion job also serves
as import validator by checking that imported coordinates are complient with
the reflection data.

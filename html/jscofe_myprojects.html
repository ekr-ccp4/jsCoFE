<h2><i>My Projects</i></h2>

<p><h3><i>1. First time</i></h3>

This is the page you find yourself in immediately after login. If you read this
text first time ever, you are probably new to jsCoFE, just logged in with temporary
password sent to you after registration. Then the first thing you want to do is
to change your temporary password for something memorisable. You do not have
to do that -- your temporary password won't expire -- but if you do, look for
the Menu icon:

<p><center><img src='../images/menu.png' height='32px'/></center><p>

in the top-left corner of the page. Click on it, then choose <i>"My Account"</i>
from the dropdown menu, and you will be presented with your account settings.
Choose and type your new password in there, press button
"<i>Update my account</i>", and job's done. You will be then taken to jsCoFE's
home page in order to login with your new password.

<p><h3><i>2. Projects</i></h3>

In jsCoFE, your work is arranged in Projects. There is no strict rules how to
use them, but a good practice would be to put all work, related to a particular
protein, into one Project. Projects start with uploading experimental data and
subsequent jobs along the following line:
<p><center>
<i>data processing<br>phasing (MR or EP)<br>density modification<br>
model building<br>refinement<br>validation and deposition</i>
</center></p>
which should result in structure solved.

<p><h3><i>3. Getting started</i></h3>

The page shows the list of projects, which is empty at start. Press "<i>Add</i>"
button in the button line above the list, and create your first project. You will
need to specify short project name, and a more descriptive title in the dialog
appeared, for example:
<p>
<center><img src='./images/add_project.png' width="600px"></center>
<p>
then press "<i>Add</i>" and see the new project appeared in the list.
<p>
The project list is both sortable (use controls found in column titles) and
selectable. In order to open a particular Project, select it and press
"<i>Open</i>" button on top of the list or, alternatively, just double-click
on the project line.
<p>
You can delete your projects as well: simply select unwanted project in the list
and press "<i>Delete</i>" button. Do this with due care: once deleted, projects
cannot be restored.

<p><h3><i>4. Project export and import</i></h3>

Using the "<i>Export</i>" button, you can download the selected project as a
compressed TAR archive. Exported archives can be uploaded later to your jsCoFE
account using the "<i>Import</i>" button above the project list.
<p>
Exporting projects may be needed if there is no disk space left in your account,
personal archival or for transferring data to another jsCoFE setup. Beware that
projects usually grow to a considerable size, from 100s MBs to few GBs. You will
be advised about the project size before downloading.

<p><h3><i>5. After work</i></h3>

Whenever you wish to end working with jsCoFE, please do logout. This can
be done through the Menu or by clicking on the exit button:

<p><center><img src='../images/logout.png' height='32px'/></center><p>

in the top-right corner. Doing so will ensure that all your data and projects
will be found in exactly the same state as you left them. Do not worry about
jobs still running: they will not be terminated if you quit your working session.
<p>
Note that jsCoFE does not support multiple logins of the same user. Each login
will forcefully terminate any other session of the same user still open.

<h2><i>Task List</i></h2>

Task List contains all tasks runnable in jsCoFE, and is used to select one
of them for the insertion in the Job Tree, further configuration (choice of
inpud data and parameters) and starting a job.
<p>
All tasks are groupped in several folders, for example, "<i>Data Import</i>",
"<i>Molecular Replacement</i>" and similar. Inside folders, relevant tasks are
listed as separate entries having a task button with icon on the left, and task
title on the right.
<p>
Each folder's name contains a number in brackets, showing how many tasks from
that folder <i>can be run</i> at given point of jsCoFE's
<a href="jscofe_project.html">Project</a>; this point corresponds to the
selected job in the Job Tree right behind the Task List:

<p><center><img src='images/task_list_1.png' width='700px'/></center><p>

If you open a folder of interest, you will
see tasks, that cannot be run, presented with titles deemed and the
corresponding task button framed in red.
<p>
A task cannot be run if there is no sufficient data for it in the given point of
the <a href="jscofe_project.html">Project</a>. You may see which data is missing
by pressing the corresponding task button -- a summary of required and available
data for the task will be shown.
<p>
If task is runnable (with icons framed in either green (no data ambiguity) or
amber (data  may need to be selected before run)), then pressing the task button
will put it as a child of the highlighted node of the Job Tree and open its
<a href="jscofe_jobdialog.html">Job Dialog</a>. In the dialog, you may need to
select input <a href="jscofe_data.html">data</a>, modify job parameters and
finally start the job by pressing "<i>Run</i>" button in Job Dialog's toolbar.

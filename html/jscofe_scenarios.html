<h2><i>Structure Solution Scenarios</i></h2>

Structure Solution in jsCoFE includes the following major steps:
<p>
<ol>
  <li>Data import</li>
  <li>Reflection data processing and Space Group Definition</li>
  <li>Asymmetric Unit Definition</li>
  <li>Phasing</li>
  <li>Density Modification</li>
  <li>Model Building</li>
  <li>Refinement</li>
  <li>Ligand Building</li>
  <li>Analysis</li>
</ol>
<p>
where the order of steps is flexible to a degree. For example, data import
may be conducted any number of times at any point of the project, although
good practices suggest import of all available data, such as reflection datasets,
sequences and molecular models, in the very beginning of the project; Asymmetric
Unit Composition, as well as the Space Group, remain hypothesis until
the structure is solved, and may be corrected at any point; Refinement is
often used as part of Phasing and so on. It is therefore possible to give only
a very general set of structure solution scenarios, with the aim to demonstrate
basic ideas behind structure solution project development in jsCoFE.

<h3>The Beginning</h3>

Any project should start with the import of all data available to the researcher.
If unmerged reflection datasets were imported, they should be merged after
import. Therefore, a typical structure solution project will start as
below:

<p><center><img src='images/scenarios_the_beginning.png' height='105px'/></center><p>

which is achieved by running the <a href='jscofe_task_import.html'>Data Import</a>
task first, and, in case of importing unmerged data,
<a href='jscofe_task_aimless.html'>Data Reduction with Aimless</a>, second. In
practice, you may need several data reduction jobs in order to choose the
optimal set of images, resolution cut-offs and other parameters (cf. the
<a href="jscofe_task_aimless.html">Data Reduction with Aimless</a>). This may be
conveniently done by cloning and re-running the data reduction job, which
will result in something like the following:

<p><center><img src='images/scenarios_the_beginning_1.png' height='120px'/></center><p>

with further development starting from the last Aimless job. At this point,
the Space Group hypothesis is created in the Project. Most structure solution
tasks also require a hypothesis on the Asymmetric Unit Composition. This is
defined in the Project with the <a href="jscofe_task_asudef.html">Asymmetric Unit
Definition</a> task. This task receives <i>merged HKL</i> reflection dataset and
<i>Sequence</i> objects on input, and produces <i>Structure Revision</i> (see
description of data types <a href="jscofe_data.html#summary">here</a>). Similarly
to the above, you may need to run a few cloned ASU Definition jobs in order to
find composition with the highest Matthews probability and solvent content
closest to 50%:

At this point, your Project is ready for the phasing stage, which may be
<p>
<ul>
  <li><a href='jscofe_mr.html'>Molecular Replacement</a></li>
  <li><a href='jscofe_ep.html'>Experimental Phasing</a></li>
  <li><a href='jscofe_mrep.html'>Combination of MR and EP</a>.
</ul>

<h2><i>Job Dialog</i></h2>

Job Dialog is one of most central to jsCoFE functionality. It is used for
forming a job (choosing/setting input data and parameters), running it and
inspecting the results. The Dialog opens automatically upon selecting a task
in the <a href="jscofe_tasklist.html">Task List</a> or pressing the
<img src="../images/openjob.svg" class="toolbutton"/> button in the
<a href="jscofe_project.html">Project Page</a> toolbar (also available through
right-click on the Job's line of the Job Tree).

<br>&nbsp;<h3>1. General Layout</h3>

The dialog has two pages: <i>Input</i> and <i>Output</i>, and a toolbar in the
upper part of the dialog:

<p><center><img src='images/job_dialog_toolbar.png' width='700px'/></center><p>

The radiobuttons in the left-hand-side of the toolbar
switch between the <i>Input</i> and <i>Output</i> pages (the buttons are
disabled if <i>Output</i> page is not formed yet). Central part of the toolbar
may show either the <i>Run</i> button for starting the job, or show a "busy"
indicator and <i>Stop</i> button while the job is running, or the final job
status (<i><b>"completed", "failed", "terminated"</b></i>) if job is finished.
The <i>Ref.</i> button displays reference documentation on the task currently
represented by the Dialog, while <i>Help</i> button provides the Dialog's
manual you are currently reading. The <i>Close</i> button in the right-hand-side
of the toolbar closes the Dialog without running the job.

<br>&nbsp;<h3>2. Input Page</h3>

The <i>Input</i> page has three parts: the Header, Data Section and Parameters
Section.

<h4>2.1 The Header</h4>

The Header displays the Job Title and two input fields: <i><b>job description</b></i>
and <i><b>ouput id</b></i>:

<p><center><img src='images/job_dialog_header.png' width='700px'/></center><p>

Both fields always have default parameters, which may be found suitable in many
cases. However, sometimes you will want to adjust them.
<p>
<table>
  <tr><td nowrap valign="top"><i><b>job description</b></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
  <td>Provides a brief job description for displaying in the Job Tree. This field
      may be used to annotate your project, for example "2nd molecular replacement
      attempt using sequence correction of the model". The field may be changed
      both before and after running the job.
  </td></tr>
  <tr><td nowrap valign="top"><i><b>output id</b></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
  <td>Provides a template name output data. Please see the "Naming" section in
      <a href="jscofe_data.html#naming">Data Management</a>. Using this field will help
      to obtain and download output files with more meaningful names.
  </td></tr>
</table>

<h4>2.2 Data Section</h4>

Data Section contains selection widgets (comboboxes) for data objects needed by
given job. Typically, a job takes several types of data, each of which will be
represented by own combobox. Some jobs may accept several data objects of a
particular type, in which case the comboboxes are repeated. In the following
example:

<p><center><img src='images/job_dialog_data_section_1.png' width='700px'/></center><p>

the job takes one <i>Structure Revision</i>, one or more anomalous <i>HKL Datasets</i>,
and one native <i>HKL Dataset</i> (see data object summary <a href="jscofe_data.html">
here</a>). Correspondingly, the Data Section presents one combobox for structure
revision, one for native dataset, and a variable number of comboboxes for anomalous
reflection datasets. Initial selections in all comboboxes are chosen according to
intrinsic task and project's logics and should be suitable in most cases; however,
this must be checked in each and every case.
<p>
In the above example, second combobox for anomalous dataset shows <i>[do not use]</i>.
This means that only one anomalous HKL dataset, selected in first combobox, will
be passed on to the job. If a user selects a dataset in second combobox as well,
it will be passed as second anomalous dataset to the job, and another combobox
with title <b>"Anomalous reflection data (3)"</b> and initial value
<i>[do not use]</i> will be displayed, thus suggesting that yet another dataset
may be passed on to the job, if needed and available.
<p>
The comboboxes may be accompanied by additional input widgets, related to
particular data object. In the above example, each anomalous dataset chosen
must be annotated by wavelength as <i>"low-remote"</i>, <i>"peak"</i>,
<i>"inflection"</i> or <i>"high-remote"</i>, which is done using additional
comboboxes displayed right below the relevant input. Similarly, the input of
native dataset is accompanied by a checkbox for specifying whether this dataset
shoud be used for phasing in addition to model building and refinement.
<p>
Finally, there is an inspection button on the left from all comboboxes with
a data object selected. Pressing this button will launch a data inspector
window, containing many useful details related to the object selected, such as
space group, cell parameters, descriptions of macromolaular chains and many
others.
<p>
Note that input widgets for optional data input will not be displayed if the
corresponding data is not found in the Project. For example, second widget for
anomalous reflection dataset in the above example would not appear if there were
only one such dataset imported or generated.

<h4>2.3 Parameters Section</h4>

Parameters Section contains various parameters of the task given. They are usually
arranged in one or more collapsable sections, like in the example below:

<p><center><img src='images/job_dialog_parameters_section.png' width='700px'/></center><p>

Individual parameters may be hidden depending on choices made by user in both
Data Section and Parameters Section, if such choices make the parameter not
applicable.


<br>&nbsp;<h3>3. Output Page</h3>

Output Page uses tabbed layout to present job results. Common tabs include
<i>"Report"</i>, <i>"Log file"</i> and <i>"Errors"</i>, some tasks may introduce
additional tabs for better structuring the output. The output is dynamic, i.e.
it progresses in real time as the corresponding job progresses, and may be viewed
at any stage.
<p>
Tabs <i>"Log file"</i> and <i>"Errors"</i> display the standard output and standard
error streams from the running job. Usually, a job involves execution of several
programs one after another, in which case their standard outputs are
concatenated. Before each program's output, <i>"Log file"</i> displays the command
line, used to invoke the program, and the the corresponding standard input stream,
which contain data and parameters read from the Input Page.
<p>
The <i>"Report"</i> tab's content and structure may vary, but you may expect it
to present the job title, report body and summary of generated data, which may be
used in subsequent tasks. A typical example of report is shown below:

<p><center><img src='images/job_dialog_output_page.png' width='750px'/></center><p>

In this Example, the report body is given by the set of sections, which are
initially folded for the brevity of presentation. Unfolding the sections reveals
fine report details, including tables, graphs and intermediate results, which
may be inspected using built-in viewers.
<p>
After the report body, there is a summary of <i>Structure Revisions</i> and
<i>Structure Data</i> generated by the job. These data objects are available for
all tasks descending from the given one, and will appear in Data Sections of
their Job Dialogs.
<p>
All generated data object references are accompanied with either inspector
buttons (as in case of <i>Structure Revisions</i>) or corresponding viewers
(in case of <i>Structure Data</i>). Thus, <i>"Coot"</i>, <i>"ccp4mg"</i> and
<i>"UglyMol"</i> buttons will launch Coot, CCP4mg or UglyMol viewers with XYZ
coordinates and density map loaded (<i>"Coot"</i> and <i>"ccp4mg"</i> buttons
will appear only if your client machine has CCP4 Suite installed and a dedicated
jsCoFE client server running). <i>"ViewHKL"</i> will laucnch a utility for the
inspection of MTZ file content. <i>"Display"</i> launches a viewer for the
inspection of XYZ file (typically in PDB format).
